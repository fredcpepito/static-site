React Static
https://github.com/react-static/react-static


React Static gathers your data, and templates together and intelligently splits 
them into bite-size static files using webpack and javascript. Once these files 
have been generated, React Static uses them to render and export a list of routes 
that you provide it into HTML files! After your site has been exported, the 
resulting data, template, and html files can be transfered to a static file 
server and browsed as an awesomely fast and performant static website!

But remember, a progressive static site is more than that...
